The game's objective is to showcase culinary skills by meticulously cutting, skillfully cooking, and expertly assembling a diverse range of ingredients, all within challenging time constraints. Prepare yourself for an adrenaline-fueled adventure as you strive to meet the demands of demanding customers in this fast-paced VR experience.
